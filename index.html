                <span><h2>Mattresses</h2>
                <p>We've seen some pretty bare-bones dorm rooms in our time, but you can't really call it housing without a mattress. (Note: The editor on this piece did once know a classmate who traded in her college-standard mattress in favor of a full-size trampoline, but she wasn't the norm.) Mattresses and mattress supports from China are on the tariff list, plus any seats that convert into beds (we're looking at you, futons.)</p></span>

                <span><h2>Furniture</h2>
                <p>Most furniture—wood or metal—is on the list, meaning desks, dressers, coffee tables and nightstands could be going up in price if suppliers pass on their costs.</p></span>
            </div>

            <div class="dots" id="hotspot3">
                <span><h2>Lighting</h2>
                <p>Those overhead florescent lights can be blinding, so many students supplement with desk lights or floor lamps, both of which are on the list of newly taxed Chinese goods. Even Christmas lights—that staple of college mood lighting—are being considered for a 10 percent tariff.</p></span>
            </div>

            <div class="dots" id="hotspot4">
                <span><h2>Paper Products</h2>
                <p>College courses are increasingly digital and that could be a good thing for students' wallets: China-made notebooks, calendars and pads of paper are on the tariff list. So are binders, folders and other back-to-school stationary basics.</p></span>
            </div>

            <div class="dots" id="hotspot5">
                <span><h2>Bags</h2>
                <p>Gym bags and backpacks are on the list of items that could see an uptick in their price if the proposed tariffs are OK'd.</p></span>
            </div>

            <div class="dots" id="hotspot6">
                <span><h2>ACs</h2>
                <p>Students at southern schools may be feeling the heat: Window air conditioning units and several types of fans were included on the list of Chinese goods that may soon see a 10 percent duty.</p></span>

            <div class="dots" id="hotspot7">
                <span><h2>Bathroom Supplies</h2>
                <p>Don't forget your shower shoes: Bathroom staples -- like toilet paper, paper towels, shampoo, after-shave and soap -- from China are being considered for duties.</p></span>
